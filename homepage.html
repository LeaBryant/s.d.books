        <p>Hello, I am so excited that you chose to stop by and check out my website. I was born and raised in Kansas with five siblings. I am a grandmother of five and enjoy writing and creating stories inspired by my grandchildren.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
        I was always an avid reader of all genres and love storytelling. I began to write short stories and poetry when I was in middle school.
          
        My first self-published book was written after I handcrafted a blanket for my granddaughter. Watching how special it was to her. I was inspired to write a story about her love for her blanket. I used pictures of her and her family to illustrate. This story became her favorite, and she asked someone to read it to her repeatedly. Thus, the story "Lola's Fuzzy Snuggly Blanket" was born.
             
        My goal when creating a new story is to layer them with colorful illustrations to help bring children into the world of the characters. Each book is easy to read and entertaining, sharing a positive message.</span></p>
